1. users to edit a daily page object
2. daily page object with the following properties:
    1.  an array of freeText objects
    2.  an array of qa objects
    3.  action object with optional time of start + time of end or just time of end or none,
        optional description, tags array
    this could be made simpler by creating only the dailyPage object and allowing editing
    of it instead of creating it as a composite object.
    For v1 lets go with the simpler option.

Maybe the dailyPage is too limiting. Not granular enough.
Should have freeText objects, qa object and action objects,
each with date and the option to add start/end.

The dailyPage can be a view in the client to organize
entries for display.

Basic reqs:
1.  user signup/login DONE
2.  add/remove textEntry DONE
    get all text entries by user DONE
3.  add/remove qaObject
    get all qaObjects by user
4.  add/remove actionObject
    get all actionObjects by user

stage 2 Reqs:
1. option to edit textEntry/qaObject/actionObject

After finishing the basic server structure,
I should start creating a client and use it for daily journaling, and add features as I see fit.
