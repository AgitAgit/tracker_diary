I want to track daily habits, goals, emotions and events.
I want to get help tracking my wishes, my goals, my actions towards them.

I want some review function that goes over the text and suggests areas where
actions and goals are incongruent.

Basic motivation:
I have a tendency to get excited about changing things and I have a hard time keeping consistent
at things. I think that having some tool to record and compile suggestions based on the ways
my winds of interest blow accross many days/months can help me stay commited to things and better
decipher what my will and direction are.

I need some set of questions to help me monitor things.
They should be repeatable and easily answerable.
They should include at least some measureable metric.
There should also be a free text section.

As a base I can look at my daily page.
How much prime hours have I invested, into what?
What tasks did I complete?
What am I proud of today?
What am I missing today?...

Maybe I can get help from someone studying psychology to choose questions relevant to my task.
Maybe I could make use of the big 5 model to model my questions

2025.04.23
1. write a basic server and get a message that its up DONE.

2.0. add dotenv and a function that connects to the db when the server runs DONE.
2.1. create a route to create users and test it (create "test" user) DONE.
3. write authentication middleware. for now I'll skip authentication. All actions will be performed through the "test" user. so the middleware will 
    simply refer to the logged in user as the test user id. DONE.

4. create a route to add textEntry, whose user ID will be taken from the currently logged in user variable(for now, test user id) DONE.

5. create a route to get all textEntry's by the authenticated user. DONE.

6. create some seeding function to add many entries to the test user. 
I can use prompts to some ai model for that. 
They can refer to older entries/some invented character with traits to generate interesting entries which can stand for realistic 
diary entries. 
Or I can look for sources online for some dummy diary of a person and try to get insights from that.

7. create a dailyPage schema that will be built of a few optional parts:
    1.  an array of freeText objects
    2.  an array of qa objects
    3.  action object with optional time of start + time of end or just time of end or none,
        optional description, tags array
    this could be made simpler by creating only the dailyPage object and allowing editing
    of it instead of creating it as a composite object.
    For v1 lets go with the simpler option.

1. users to edit a daily page object
2. daily page object with the following properties:
    1.  an array of freeText objects
    2.  an array of qa objects
    3.  action object with optional time of start + time of end or just time of end or none,
        optional description, tags array
    this could be made simpler by creating only the dailyPage object and allowing editing
    of it instead of creating it as a composite object.
    For v1 lets go with the simpler option.

Maybe the dailyPage is too limiting. Not granular enough.
Should have freeText objects, qa object and action objects,
each with date and the option to add start/end.

The dailyPage can be a view in the client to organize
entries for display.

Basic reqs:
1.  user signup/login DONE
2.  add/remove textEntry DONE
    get all text entries by user DONE
3.  add/remove qaObject
    get all qaObjects by user
4.  add/remove actionObject
    get all actionObjects by user

stage 2 Reqs:
1. option to edit textEntry/qaObject/actionObject

After finishing the basic server structure,
I should start creating a client and use it for daily journaling, and add features as I see fit.
